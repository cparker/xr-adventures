# Sunday May 22nd West Magnolia

West Magnolia trails were in great shape today.  We were worried about snow and mud, but it was surprisingly dry. 

The weather was pretty perfect : sunny and slightly cool.  It got a little cloudy by the time we left around 2.

The drive up there is cake.  Very little traffic today

We did many laps of the loop in the middle, which is 355d.  The puddles on the western part were pretty deep and a bit challenging.  The gate was still closed at road 105, so the trails were pretty limited today.

There is a strange clearing in the middle that we'll need to explore on a future trip.  The USFS topo claims there is a CU Observatory in the area?
