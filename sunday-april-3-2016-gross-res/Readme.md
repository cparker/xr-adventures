Gross Reservoir Sunday, April 3, 2016
============

I started today intending to ride all the way up to Rollinsville, then on to Gamble Gulch Rd. off peak to peak HW.  But by the time I was halfway up Coal Creek Canyon it was only 50 degrees and I was a bit under dressed.  I settled for a shorter ride around Gross Res instead.

The road gets more interesting after turning N off of Hw 72

At this point you have to decide to either visit the N or S shore

These picnic areas are nice, but crazy windy and cold today

This road called Miremont Rd, which I don't remember seeing, heads back to Hw72.  Something to explore next time.
